  e.g the skin effect of a real inductor makes the built in inductance model
  less accurate.

  If termal modeling is enabled (see ch 8 in manual) the computed
  power dissipation in resistors is presented in the component list.

  PSD files located in the lib folder as the power spectral
  density of the music clips has an impact on how the is distributed over the
  components.
